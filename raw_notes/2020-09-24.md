# Notes for 2020-09-24

## Actions

- Created a env file for Intertal IP, should investigate if there is a metadata service 
on IBM cloud like:
```bash
INTERNAL_IP=$(curl -s -H "Metadata-Flavor: Google" \
  http://metadata.google.internal/computeMetadata/v1/instance/network-interfaces/0/ip)
```

internal ips:
10.240.129.6
10.240.129.16
10.240.129.17

- Had to "open" up all of the network security groups because it was stopping the
Loadbalancer from finding the `/` endpoint.
kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local - did not work in the health check
nor did /healthz work either.

- Our external ip for the loadbalancer is 169.48.95.216
52a4b99f-us-south.lb.appdomain.cloud


# We have problems with the external loadbalancer, and my worker nodes are not found.
